Clippy AI is a simple wrapper around [OpenAI Codex](https://openai.com/blog/openai-codex/). It allows you to send Codex your current file as well as some instructions in plain-text English on an operation to perform. It then opens a diff view in your editor so you can easily see the suggested changes and accept or reject them.

For more details on the VS Code extension, see [./vs-code-extension](./vs-code-extension)
